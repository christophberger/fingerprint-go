# How to generate a browser fingerprint in Go

Malicious behavior is difficult to detect. Browser fingerprinting can help identify certain patterns of fraudulent activities.

This demo project uses Fingerprint Pro to take a browser fingerprint of a user's device during signup. If a fraudster tries to generate multiple fake accounts through the same device, the generated brower fingerprint reveals that attempt. 

This project was created for an article on the [Fingerprint blog](https://fingerprint.com/blog/).
